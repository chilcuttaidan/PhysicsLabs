# Advanced Physics Labs


This repository conatains "virtualized" advanced physics labs. They were made during the Spring and Fall of 2020, to allow physics majors to continue their degree progress during the world-wide COVID-19 pandemic. 

There are no data-derived results here, but everything posted will allow you to arrive at the results yourself. In other words, you must engage in each lab, "take data" from any videos or images, understand how each works, and do the analysis to arrive at a given result.

It is hoped the quaratine version of these labs allows the students to do all labs work except (unfortunately) to push the buttons on the equipment.

## Cratering

Craters made by a projectile (like a small metal ball) in a porous material (like sand) follow a scaling law. Here is a [video](Labs/Cratering/Apparatus/slmo_crater.mov) of a crater being formed. This scaling law also included large cratering events, like that of the Barringer Crater.  

The scaling is between the ingoing (kinetic) energy of the projectile vs the diameter of the eventual crater.  The scaling law involves a fractional power.  In the case where energies of in the ingoing projectile do not vaporize the sand/crater (i.e. all energy is mechanical), the power is 0.25.  See [this paper](Labs/Cratering/Info/crater_paper.pdf).  

The apparatus used here looks [like this.](Labs/Cratering/Apparatus/app01.jpg)

### Data Taking

In the Data folder, you'll find pairs of images, like 001_drop.jpg and 001_crater.jpg.  Each pair shows the drop height of a small metal ball and an image of the resulting crater, which a ruler placed on top of it.  Ball parameters:

* Iron ball, mass=65.29 +/- 0.01 g, dia=25.81 +/- 0.01 cm
* Al ball, mass=22.7 +/- 0.01 g, dia=25.64 +/- 0.01 cm
