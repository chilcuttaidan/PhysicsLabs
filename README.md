# Advanced Physics Labs


This repository conatains "virtualized" advanced physics labs. There are generally no results here. You must engage in each lab, 
understand how each works, and do the analysis yourself to obtain a given result.

# Cratering

Craters made in a porous material like sand, in the case where energies of in the ingoing craters do not vaporize the sand/crater, follow a scaling law 
involving a fractional power.
