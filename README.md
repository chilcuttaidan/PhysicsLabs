# Advanced Physics Labs


This repository conatains "virtualized" advanced physics labs. They were made during the Spring and Fall of 2020, to allow physics majors to continue their degree progress during the world-wide COVID-19 pandemic. 

There are generally no results here. One must engage in each lab, "take data" from any videos or images, understand how each works, and do the analysis to obtain a given result.

## Cratering

Craters made by a projectile (like a small metal ball) in a porous material (like sand) follow a scaling law. This scaling law also included large cratering events, like that of the Barringer Crater.  The scaling is between the ingoing (kinetic) energy of the projectile vs the diameter of the eventual crater.  The scaling law involves a fractional power.  In the case where energies of in the ingoing projectile do not vaporize the sand/crater (i.e. all energy is mechanical), the power is 0.25.  See the paper in the Info folder.
