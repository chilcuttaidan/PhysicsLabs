understand how each works, and do the analysis yourself to obtain a given result.

## Cratering

Craters made by a projectile in a porous material like sand follow a scaling law.  The scaling is between the ingoing (kinetic) energy of a crater vs the diameter of the eventual crater.  The scaling law involves a fractional power.  In the case where energies of in the ingoing projectile do not vaporize the sand/crater (i.e. all energy is mechanical), the power is 0.25.  See the paper in the Info folder.
